# Introduction

## Purpose
Promover que alumnos de preparatoria o más jovenes escojan carreras STEAM. Se desarrollara un videojuego que sea atrativo y que provoque interes en un área STEAM.

## Scope
Alumnos mexicanos entre 9 y 18 años.

## Definitions and Acronyms
STEAM: ciencias, tecnologías, ingeniería, artes y matemáticas (por sus siglas en inglés)

# Overall Description
Un videojuego original 

## User classes
Jugadores: Alumno que utilizará el juego

Analista de STEAM: Miembro de la OSF que verá el progreso de los jugadores en el juego 

## Assumptions and Dependencies
Suposiciones: 
Desarrollar una habilidad relacionada con un área de conocimiento genera un interés en esa área.

El jugador tiene una conexión a internet, un na

Are there any assumptions you’re making that could turn out to be false? You should include those here, as well.

Finally, you should note if your project is dependent on any external factors. This might include software components you’re reusing from another project.

# System Features and Requirements
This is where you detail the specific requirements for building your product.

## Functional Requirements
The functional requirements describe the services and functions of a system. Functional requirements must be precise and unambiguous.

Include user stories, which are short descriptions of a feature, told from the perspective of one of your end user profiles. They are typically structured in the following fashion:

> As a __[type of user]__, I want __[some goal]__ so that __[some reason]__.

You may want to use the following template table.

|Title|User story|Importance|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|_Short identifier_|_As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]_|_Must have_|_Write here any additional consideration_|

## External Interface Requirements
External interface requirements are types of functional requirements. They outline how your product will interface with other components or systems.

There are several types of interfaces you may have requirements for, including:
- User
- Hardware
- Software
- Communications

## Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are restrictions on the system or the development process. Non-functional requirements can be more critical than functional ones. If they are not met, the system is useless!

# Screens
Identifying the individual screens (for an app), or pages (for a website) are where a product’s shape starts to become clear. They are a distillation of the user stories into a set of distinct sections that satisfy the needs and behaviors identified so far. The process of outlining an application’s screens may also highlight any requirements or considerations that have been overlooked up to this point.

This has the dual purpose of both contributing to a more accurate vision of the product early on, and serving as a jumping-off point for the time when designers do get involved.

## Wireframes
Wireframes are simple page layouts that outline the size and placement of elements, and features on a page. They are generally devoid of color, font styles, logos or any design elements.

Wireframing is probably the most time-consuming step of this process and for some simple projects, it may be overkill. For complex projects where serious design thinking needs to happen, wireframes are an indispensable tool.
